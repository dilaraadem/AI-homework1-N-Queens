# AI_hw1_N_Queens

Homework Description:
On the N-queens problem, implement the hill-climbing, simulated annealing, local beam search and genetic algorithms. Research the algorithms using the web. The application must have a graphical user interface and you must enable the user to change algorithm parameters. For simulated annealing, the user should be able to change the starting temperature and the cooling factor. For local beam search, the user should be able to change the number of states. For the genetic algorithm, the user should be able to change the size of a single generation, the percent of elitism, the crossover probability, the mutation probability and the number of generations.

This application consists of a Graphical User Interface, which has the option to select the algorithm and the board size. Board size can be selected between 4 and 8. It calculates the heuristic value and also counts the steps.
